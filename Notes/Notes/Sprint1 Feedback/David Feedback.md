# Paddle bounce ball and break brick

Not super intuitive initially, but then you realize its going through really consistent patterns
Didnt matter where, just that you hit it
Same exact trajectories

No. Background very distracting. Consistent styling, lot of detail in the background and the game stuff was simple

No cuz it always breaks cuz the same patterns

No

Not really

Do you find it engaging?
Eh. not much to be engaged with
