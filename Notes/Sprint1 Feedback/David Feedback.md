# Paddle bounce ball and break brick

## Paddle

Do you find it easy to control the paddle?
Yes. Pretty straightforward, super easy (maybe it should be harder?)

## Ball

Do you find the movement of the ball predictable?
Not super intuitive initially, but then you realize its going through really consistent patterns
Didnt matter where, just that you hit it
Same exact trajectories ^606715

## Brick Breaking

Do you find breaking the bricks satisfying?
No. Background very distracting. Consistent styling, lot of detail in the background and the game stuff was simple ^cef02a

Do you find it difficult to break the bricks?
No cuz it always breaks cuz the same patterns ^ff3c64

## Win/Lose

Do you think the objective was clear? What do you think the objective is?
Was clear. (game played before) win/lose screens clear even if not initially clear

Do you feel a sense of accomplishment when you win?
No ^21e9e7

Do you feel shameful when you die?
Not really

Do you find it engaging?
Eh. not much to be engaged with

Interviews better at early stages, small number later. Forms when mature and need to distribute to a lot
